# Surf's Up
# Overview
# Purpose
Last year on vacation, I discovered, a new passion in Hawaii called surfing. When thinking about my long-term goal, it is to spend all my time and energy in Hawaii and developing my surfing skills. However, to finance a lifestyle like this I must identify a way to make money. There is demand that can be met by providing physical goods, such as ice cream, surfboards, and surf equipment to both locals and tourists. It will be called "Surf n' Shake Shack".

In order to finance this business, and ultimately lifestly, I will be tapping into my personal savings and looking for an investor(s). I presented my business plan to W. Avy and it was a great personal and professional match. Before W. Avy invests in my business, he wants to see data on the local monthly temperatures. Luckly I am a data analyst and can provide my future investor with the information he needs to feel comfortable in this transaction. To mitigate any failed business adventures due to poor temperatures (to cold to eat ice cream or surf), my data will have me surfing the waves in no time!

## Finding One: June - The Hottest Month

It was determined during the data analysis that it is most important to look at the hotest month of the year and its relative temperatures. If the temperatures are to high or too low it may prevent shopers and surfers from visiting the shop. For the hottest month of the year, June was the front runner. Our collected data is the temperatures of Oahu, Hawaii for the month of June in 2017. We had a total sample size of 191 random temperatures taken throughout that month. It was found that the mean temperature in June was 77 degrees with a high of 83 and a low of 71. Based on these numbers W. Avy agreed, even in this variable month, these temperatures would sustain a health demand of ice cream and surfing gear purchases.

## Finding Two: December - The Coldest Month

It was determined during the data analysis that it is most important to look at the coldest month of the year and its relative temperatures. If the temperatures are to high or too low it may prevent shopers and surfers from visiting the shop. For the coldes month of the year, December was the front runner. Our collected data is the temperatures of Oahu, Hawaii for the month of December in 2016. We had a total sample size of 200 random temperatures taken throughout that month. It was found that the mean temperature in December was 71 degrees with a high of 78 and a low of 60. Based on these numbers W. Avy agreed, even in this variable month, these temperatures would sustain a health demand of ice cream and surfing gear purchases.

## Finding Three: December - The Most Variable Month

It was determined that although December proved satisfactory temperatures, the minimum temperature found could cause problems with one portion of the business. In colder temperatures, surfers can easily adjust their gear by choosing to wear wetsuits to retain heat. This demand can increase surf equipment revenue. However, in colder temperatures ice cream sales might see a decline in demand and therefore revenue. For this reason, it could be advantageous for Surf n' Shake Shack to pivot their winter edible products. Instead of selling ice cream, they can easily transition to selling hot coco, coffee, tea, etc. Although, the increase in wetsuit and cold weather surf gear might bridge the gap any decrease in ice cream demand may cause. It is imperative to look at this difference in year one Q3 and Q4 financial statements.
