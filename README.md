# Surf's Up
# Overview
## Purpose
   Last year on vacation, I discovered, a new passion in Hawaii called surfing. When thinking about my long-term goal, it is to spend all my time and energy in Hawaii and developing my surfing skills. However, to finance a lifestyle like this I must identify a way to make money. There is demand that can be met by providing physical goods, such as ice cream, surfboards, and surf equipment to both locals and tourists. It will be called "Surf n' Shake Shack".
   
   In order to finance this business, and ultimately lifestly, I will be tapping into my personal savings and looking for an investor(s). I presented my business plan to W. Avy and it was a great personal and professional match. Before W. Avy invests in my business, he wants to see data on the local monthly temperatures. Luckly I am a data analyst and can provide my future investor with the information he needs to feel comfortable in this transaction. To mitigate any failed business adventures due to poor temperatures (to cold to eat ice cream or surf), my data will have me surfing the waves in no time!
